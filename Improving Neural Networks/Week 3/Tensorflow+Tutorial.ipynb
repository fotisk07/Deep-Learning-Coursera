    "Welcome to this week's programming assignment. Until now, you've always used numpy to build neural networks. Now we will step you through a deep learning framework that will allow you to build neural networks more easily. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle, Torch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up your machine learning development significantly. All of these frameworks also have a lot of documentation, which you should feel free to read. In this assignment, you will learn to do the following in TensorFlow: \n",

    "- Tensorflow is a programming framework used in deep learning\n",
    "- The two main object classes in tensorflow are Tensors and Operators. \n",
    "- When you code in tensorflow you have to take the following steps:\n",
    "    - Create a graph containing Tensors (Variables, Placeholders ...) and Operations (tf.matmul, tf.add, ...)\n",
    "    - Create a session\n",
    "    - Initialize the session\n",
    "    - Run the session to execute the graph\n",
    "- You can execute the graph multiple times as you've seen in model()\n",
    "- The backpropagation and optimization is automatically done when running the session on the \"optimizer\" object."
